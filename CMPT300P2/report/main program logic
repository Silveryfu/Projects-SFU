Main Program Logic

---------------------------------------------------------------
The logic of running thread structure:

There are 1 mother thread and 6 children threads running.
The mother thread create children threads.
6 children threads stand for:
	1. Long-term scheduler
	2. Mid-term scheduler
	3. Short-term scheduler
	4. Processor 1
	5. Processor 2
	6. Processor 3

Those 6 children threads act together to form the basic functions of operating system.

---------------------------------------------------------------
The logic of data structure:

Ready queue is an individual object, which was first initialized in main function.
Block queue is an individual object, which was first initialized in main function.
Each processor is an individual object, which was first initialized in main function.
Master Processor is an individual object, including short-term, mid-term and long-term schedulers, which was first initialized in main function.
Each process is an individual object, which was first initiazlied in long-term scheduler and deleted in long-term scheduler after finishing executing.
