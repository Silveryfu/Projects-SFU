CMPT 371 Data Communications and Networking
Project 1

Due date: 5:00pm, October 21, 2013 (Mon)

Note: Late submission will NOT be accepted! 
This is a group-based project, and each group should submit ONE printed report only, which should include all the source codes and necessary discussions. Please include the names and student IDs of all the group members in the report. 

Grading Scheme: The total mark of project 1 is 100, which contributes 5% toward the final grade.


1. (15%) Find the names and IP addresses of the following servers at
SFU:
         WEB, DNS, SSH, SMTP, IMAP (or POP)

You might find multiple names or IP addresses, and we will accept any reasonable answers. 


2. (30%) Implement a basic Chord DHT. The input format is as follows :

    S                 //Hash space [0-S]
    N                //Number of nodes
    M                //Number of keys
    id1, id2, , idN     //Hashed node ids, joined in order
    k1,k2,,kM        //Hashed keys, joined in order

  For slides Application Layer 2: 52-56, the input will be

     7
     4
     2
     1,2,0,6
     7,1

   Then for each key, assume that node id1 will issue a query (in the above example, node 1 will query key 7, and then key 1. You should find out the path for each query. Your program should first prompt an input file name (say, XXX.in), and write all the results (one path per line) to file XXX.out. For the input file above, the output should be 

1 6 0                       // node 1 query key 7
1                          //node 1 query key 1
    
  You should include your code in the report.


3. (25%) Write a base64 encoder, which should read a binary file (XXX.in) and output the encoded data to XXX.out. Here, XXX represents the input file name, which should be read from the command line. You can assume that the total number of bits of the input file is divisible by 6. 


4. (30%) Finish WireShark Labs in the textbook (P78 and 181) Packet sniffer, HTTP, and DNS. Include all your answers in the report. 

5. (Optional) Socket programming assignment 1: Web Server (textbook P179). This assignment uses Python, with which some students may not be familiar. Therefore, its optional only and we will not mark it.
